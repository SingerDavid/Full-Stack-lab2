ITMD-542-02 Full-Stack Web Development
Git Repository: https://github.com/SingerDavid/Full-Stack-lab2.git
Project Description:
- This is a simple project meant to implement basic CRUD operations within a new development environment, see next section. The goal is to practice these CRUD operation utilizing a JSON file rather than a cloud or native based database.
Development Environment:
- This is a Node JS Express Generated Application utilizing REST API architecture nad follows the PUG html template styles.
Installation:
- To run this program simply download the files to your local repository from the github link and then proceed to run npm install - this will install all of the listed dependencies required to run this project. From there, in the terminal type npm run dev. Then proceed to your favorite internet browsing application and navigate to localhost 3000.
Insights and Results:
- I actually really enjoyed learning about this new environment and utilizing different html templates that exists. The generator made this startup process easy, although I ran the same thing 4 times before it gave me the wanted results. I can see how this all ties into a full stack application especially utilizing the controllers. considering other aspects of full stack I have worked in I think i see a way to connect all of these in a somewhat efficient manner. It all still seems like it will get much more complex. I had issues with the css, maybe I need to touch up more to get the basics down, but of things I knew they seemed to not work how I originally intended them to.
